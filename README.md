# PersiL
A simple python project for computing persistent homology. My goal is to have some code nice enough to be able to add it to [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org "Tiens tiens quelle surprise :)") !


## TODO

* Comment code
* Add a guide
* Organize files and code
* Persistence diagrams and barcodes
